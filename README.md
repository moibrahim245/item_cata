Item Catalog

About :
This project is a RESTful web application utilizing the Flask framework which accesses a SQL database that populates 
categories and their items. OAuth2 provides authentication for further CRUD functionality on the application. Currently OAuth2 is implemented for Google Accounts.

In This Repo :
This project has one main Python module app.py which runs the Flask application.
A SQL database is created using the database_setup.py module and you can populate the database with test data using database_init.py. 
The Flask application uses stored HTML templates in the tempaltes folder to build the front-end of the application. 
CSS/JS/Images are stored in the static directory.
